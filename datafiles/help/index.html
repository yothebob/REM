      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our residential estimating program help guide! This tool has been used for years my PRO's very own staff
          and now we have opened it up to our contactors to use too! This tool is essential to creating quick price estimates and accurate parts lists!
          This tool was built with speed and simplicity in mind so take offs will be easier then ever before! Below you will see a quick start guide, Above on the navigation bar
          are detailed sections going into each part of this program. Supplied in "Additional Information" will also be a powerpoint presentation for ease of training staffing.

      <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
        <p>After opening the program you will have a blank grid for drawing, to the left you will have an item list that can be opened or closed
        by clicking the gray arrow. To the right is the rail section calculator where it will show you your deck runs and it will show you how
      much top rail scrap when assembling your railing. At the top is a large bar with all your tools. The tools are divided into sections by "|".
     Going from left to right you have your file tools, then your calculating tools, then drawing scale, top railing selector, color, post selector, program version
   and finally the help button!</p>

      <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>When you open the program the drawing line tool will already be selected for you to start drawing your deck. Drawing lines and inserting posts will snap to the grid.
        Posts lines and measurements will "half-snap" which means they can snap anywhere half of the width of a box. To turn off snapping you can click the grid icon in the middle left
        of the top bar. <strong>Insert posts into your drawing by right clicking</strong> and the post will be placed where your cursor is. If you want to <strong>delete a post hover over that post with your cursor and click the "Delete" button.</strong>
      On the top right of the icon bar will be the post types. If you are estimating glass or picket railing you will only need to use undrilled posts, if you are doing cable railing you will need to use the other posts. Check in the "Icons" section of the help guide to get more info about different posts.
    If you hover over the icon with your cursor it will tell you what type of post that is. You can select posts by clicking the icon or using the mouse scroll wheel for quick post changing. </p>
      <h2>Measuring</h2>
        <p>Once you have your drawing finished, you can put in the deck measurement by using the measuring tools. Click the measuring icon on the middle right in the tool bar (The last icon to the right in the drawing tools).
        Before measuring your deck you will want to make sure your scaling is approperate to your deck lengths. The default scaling is 1 box = 1'. But you can adjust that from 1 box = 6" to 1 box = 4'. When you are ready to measure just measure the
      lines just as you drew them. The measurement will automaticly be recorded as a deck length. <strong>If you are measuring stairs they will be measured differently!</strong> please do not use the measurement tool for stairs, that will throw off your estimate.</p>
      <h2>Creating a parts list</h2>
        <p>Totaling parts list is now easier then ever! Once you have everything the way you want it you can <strong>press "R" or click the total parts icon on the top left</strong>. It will prompt a series of questions to awnser. Once you are done you can open the
        parts list on the left of the screen. If you need to change anything you can simply press "R" or the totaling icon again and restart the parts totaling. If you want to see the approximate price of the materials your railing will take you can click the
      price total icon and it will print the approximate total price at the bottom of the rail meausurement tool.</p>
      <h2>Saving/exporting</h2>
        <p>Once you are done with everything you can save the drawing for later refrence and you can export the parts into an excel document. Press the save icon to save the drawing, which will be saved as a photo. Then click the export button to have it
        create an excel file for you. You can give one of out sales reps the drawing and list and an order can be placed right away!</p>
