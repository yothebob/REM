      <h1>Learning The System</h1>
       <p>Although this tool may be intuative for some it may be completely foriegn to others! Well if you are alittle lost, you have come to the right place! Below we will explain how to understand how to draw the your deck and choose the proper railing system and parts for you.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="info-block">
         <h1>Cable Railing</h1>
         <p>Cable railing takes alittle more planning then the other types of railing. One of those reasons is because you have to plan out the cable runs and where they should start and stop. Here are the basic rules for creating cable runs, cables should...</p>
           <ol>
             <li>Be no longer then 40 ft.</li>
             <li>Not go through more then 2 corners. </li>
             <li>Not go through a corner and then down a staircase.</li>
             <li>Have a terminal side, and a tensioning side </li>
           </ol>
           <h2>How do I know the difference between Terminal and Tensioning?</h2>
             <p>Glad you asked! A tensioning side of the cable will need to go through both sides of a post, Meanwhile a terminal end will only need to go into one side of the post. This can make for a huge variety in how cable can be run. The section below will tell you more on how to pick the proper post according to your cable runs. </p>
       </div>
       <div class="info-block">
         <h1>Types of Posts</h1>
          <p>Within this program there are a few different types of posts you should know about before creating a quote. If you are planning on quoting cable railing there are different posts based off the lay out of your deck.</p>
         <h2>Glass and Picket Railing Post Types</h2>
         <ul>
           <li><h3>UD Post</h3></li>
           <p>The undrilled (UD) post is the only post type used for Picket and glass railing! One note of caution is that if you have stairs, all stair posts will be UD posts and The starting post and stopping post for every staircase should be 42" tall for any adjustments needed in the field.</p>
         </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="info-block">
           <h2>Cable Railing Post Types</h2>
           <ul>
             <li><h3>DT Post</h3></li>
              <p>This post is the most common post for cable railing. You will use a drilled through post (DT) on any intermidiate post that is not an end of the railing ALSO will be used on a rail section end for cable tensioning. If you have stairs and are continuing railing from the deck town the stairs, you WILL NOT use a DT post for any post on the stairs. Stair posts need to be drilled in the field. Undrilled posts should be used for start, stop and intermidiate posts on stairs. </p>
            <li><h3>1S Post</h3></li>
              <p>One sided (1S) posts are used when you are terminating a railing section. The other terminal post should be a drilled through (DT) to accomidate cable tensioning.</p>
              <li><h3>90 Post</h3></li>
              <p>These will be used for going around 90 degree corners on your deck.</p>
              <li><h3>3S Post</h3></li>
              <p>The 3-sided (3S) post is simular to the 90 degree post. But the 3S is specifically made for accomidating 1 tensioning side and one terminal end. </p>
           </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="info-block">
            <h1>Mounting Method</h1>
              <p>One important decision you have to make is how you want to mount your railing. There are really only two options, Surface mount and Fascia mount. Down below I will go into some of the pros and cons of each, hopefully this will help you decide what is the right choice for you!</p>
              <ul>
                <li><h3>Surface Mount</h3></li>
                  <p>Surface mount will be directly mounted to your deck surface. This is our standard mounting method but there are some things to know before choosing surface mount. Surface mount is the cheaper of the two mounting methods, but often times you will lose alittle bit more usable deck space becuase the railing is mounted on top of the deck versus on the outside face of your deck. Surface mount is also easy to install if you are installing yourself, just mock up the posts as is and anchor them down! But, If you have a waterproof deck surface mount may not be the best method for you becuase you will be directly penitrating the waterproof surface. Although we do use rubber gaskets and sealent, It may not hold up as long versus alternative mounting methods.</p>
                <li><h3>Fascia Mount</h3></li>
                  <p>Fascia mount is great for many reasons but may not be the right choice for you. Fasica mounting is where we will mount to the outside surface of your deck. This option will not take up any deck space! Fascia mounting is great but may not be recommended for first time DIY-ers because of the added complexity. Fasica mount also makes a great option for waterproof decks! A couple of things to consider is fascia will add to the cost (approximately 15-25%), and you should check with your deck to make sure there is enough clearence to mount on the outside edge. you will need about 6-8" clear past the edge of your deck, otherwize a fascia bracket will not be able to be installed. </p>
              </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="info-block">
           <h1>Post Spacing</h1>
           <p>Now that you understand the different types of posts, cable runs, and mounting options; we will need to know post spacing! Posts should be spaced as evenly as possible and each infill has a diffent spacing (measured in ft). Our railing was engineered for these spacings, you can space your posts closer if needed but DO NOT exceed the post spacing as stated per engineering.</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Cable Rail - 4FT</li>
             <li>Glass Rail - 5FT</li>
             <li>Picket Rail - 6FT</li>
           </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="info-block">
           <h1>Moving on...</h1>
           <p>Now that you know about the railing system we will teach you how to use this software to get a quote quickly and easily for any deck or railing style! If you are ready to dive right in I suggest you look at the "Overview" page for the quickstart guide. For training a team we have a powerpoint in the "Additional Information" page If you want a more in depth guide to all the features of this software please move over to the "Icons" page to start learning about all the tools at your disposal!
