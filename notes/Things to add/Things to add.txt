Features that would be nice to add:
- update pricing automaticly (ONLINE)

- lerping on menus
- email quote (needs to be secure)
- when totaling maybe pull up a page with all the questions on one page (simular to a form)

BUGS TO FIX:

automatic post layer for picket, cable and glass (need the folowing additonal features):
