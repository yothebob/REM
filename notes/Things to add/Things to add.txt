Features that would be nice to add:
- update pricing automaticly (ONLINE)
- make mobile app version
- GUI facelift?
- lerping on menus
- add actual saving and opening , maybe ini file? 
- email quote (needs to be secure)
- when totaling maybe pull up a page with all the questions on one page (simular to a form)

items to create
- stair base plate
- add TTHS long for staircases 

BUGS TO FIX:
- FMPBS1 on csv reads from line 6. everything else reads from line 7...

control + z undo was added. undo features only work with lines, text, rectangles.

- lines,rectangles, text and posts are not drawing to surface until ready to save. I need to make everything else not draw 
to the surface.
