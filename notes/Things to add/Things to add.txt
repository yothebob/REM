Features that would be nice to add:
- update pricing automaticly online
- make mobile app version
- GUI facelift?
- lerping on menus
- add actual saving and opening , maybe ini file? 
- email quote (needs to be secure)
- when totaling maybe pull up a page with all the questions on one page (simular to a form)

items to create
- stair base plate
- add TTHS long for staircases 

BUGS TO FIX:
- FMPBS1 on csv reads from line 6. everything else reads from line 7...

control + z undo was added. but it may not work with constant width changes, also WILL NOT work with 
imported backgrounds.

- i need to find a way to have drawings temperarly and then bake them in to the surface when saving. it
will be more memory efficient and be easier to use.
